## Description:
Turtle Racing is a fun and interactive game built using Python's `turtle` and `random` modules. The game involves six colorful turtles racing to the finish line. The player places a bet on one of the turtles' colors, and if the selected turtle wins, the player wins; otherwise, they lose. The turtles start at the same x-position but are positioned at different y-positions. Each turtle moves forward randomly with varying speeds to add unpredictability to the race.

## How to Use:
1. Run the game by executing `app.py`.
2. When prompted, type the color of the turtle you want to bet on (options: red, orange, green, yellow, blue, purple).
3. The race will start automatically, and the result will be displayed once the race ends.

   ```

## Running the Program
1. Ensure Python 3.9 or later is installed on your system.
2. To run the program:
   - **Using PyCharm**: Open the project in PyCharm and run `app.py`.
   - **Using Terminal/Command Prompt**: Navigate to the project folder and execute:
     ```bash
     python app.py
